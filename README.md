# BEP

This code consists of 3 steps
- First the dataset used to train the neural network is created. This is done based on the files in the 'source_data' folder.
This dataset is saved in a folder 'data', not included in this rep because of the files sizes.
- Secondly the model is trained, im working on how to save the best model properly. Now checkpoints are saved in the 'saved_models' folder, not included in this rep either
- Thirdly, the model can be used to predict labels on a unknown network
